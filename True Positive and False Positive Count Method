#True Positive and False Positive Count Method:

CWE476 Null Pointer Dereference test cases of Juliet Test Suite consist of flawed and unflawed test cases, named as Positives and Negatives in our related research.

The test cases have file groups based on name, numbering, and suffix. Juliet sometimes uses the concept of a data source and a data sink to divide the chain of events
leading to a flaw. The naming convention of Julietâ€™s Positives uses bad() for the entry into a flaw, and this may, in turn, use a badSource() and badSink() pattern. 
It also uses good() for representing the Negatives, which in turn consist of goodSource() and goodSink().

Detecting a test case within a line inside a bad(), badSink() or badSource() considered a true positive (TP). Consequently, detections within a line inside a good(),
 goodSink() or goodSource() considered a false positive (TP)
